lua_engine wishlist:

    [DONE!] Full stack traces for "Lua thread bombed out"
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12256455/print-stacktrace-from-c-code-with-embedded-lua

    [DONE!] getemuscreen for gui.gdscreenshot
        XBackBuf already accessible (uint8 *buf = &XBuf)
    string memory.readfullrange (if readbyterange is too slow)
        ??? readfunc ARead; might be too low-level...

    [DONE!] Fix print to not do extra \r\n

    emu.romfilename
        FileBase

    Movie commands:
        [Needs Testing] movie.play(string filename, bool read_only, int pauseframe)
            FCEUI_LoadMovie(const char *fname, bool _read_only, int _pauseframe)

        [Needs Testing] movie.record(string filename, int flags, string author)
            FCEUI_SaveMovie(const char *fname, EMOVIE_FLAG flags, std::wstring author)

            Flags = FROM_POWERON, FROM_SAVERAM, NONE (partial movie)

        movie.getinfo?
            FCEUI_MovieGetInfo(FCEUFILE* fp, MOVIE_INFO& info, bool skipFrameCount)

        movie.savebackup?
            FCEUI_MakeBackupMovie(bool dispMessage)



    --novideo option (SDL Xwindow NULL interface?)

--------------------

Other DQN improvements:

    * [DONE!] Use speed run movie data as training examples
    * [DONE!] Run through entire speed run movies as training data in the beginning
    * Actrep should get smaller and smaller (every 500K steps, for example)
    * Save movies, for both example runs and fast runs
    * Split up NN into levels (might be still too hard for 8-4)
    * Make sure networks are competing for time/reward/whatever
    * Add adrenaline for dangerous gameplay:
        * Use 4 different savestates (1/10/100/1000 frames back) to revert back to while in "death spiral"
        * Add greater reward for being close to a death spiral frame point
        * Actually hitting death still incurs a penalty
